<h3>Description of the application</h3>

The purpose is to create a website to regroup 3 groups of users:
<li>- Non-profit organizations: They will organize tournament for the gamers</li>
<li>- Donors: They will finance to organize the and to give some prizes to the winners</li>
<li>- Gamers: They are the actors of the event. People who want to play, to show their skills and/or to win some prizes.</li>

<h3>Optimistic results:</h3>
A platform where anyone can create, donate to or participate in an event. Each event will have an amount to reach until a deadline. If the goal is not reached, the event is cancelled or the organizer can postpone the event. If the event is cancelled, donors are refunded.
Pessimistic results:
If things go not smoothly, payments will not be done online and it’s the organizer who will update the amount funded.

<h3>Motivations</h3>
We like games and we have a competitive spirit. We do not see a lot of game events organized. We would like to help people to have more opportunities in the e-Sport.

<h3>Minimum hours</h3>
We are planning to spend 10 to 15 hours per week because we have others classes and some of us have their own company to manage.

<h3>Development methodology</h3>
We will use pair programming but not scrum methods because our planning is not the same, we don’t have a lot of free time in common.

<h3>After this semester</h3>
If the project works and people use it, we can envisage to maintain it in the future as an open-source and useful website
